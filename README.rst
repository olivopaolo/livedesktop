Bring your desktop wallpaper alive!

Introduction
============

**livedesktop** periodically sends network requests to obtain the
view of a public webcam; the obtained image is written to a target
file, which is periodically refreshed.

Configure your desktop wallpaper to slide show, and select the
target folder in order to have the webcam view on your desktop.
